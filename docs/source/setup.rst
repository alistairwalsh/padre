How to use this library
=========================

Accessing the data
********************

Recommended Method
--------------------

Since Python is a great language, and the library provides a lot of convenience functions for you, 
the recommended method for accessing the data is using Python scripts that directly include the
library.

The Not-Recommended Method
---------------------------

If you hate Python, kittens, and love, you could write all of your scripts in some awful language,
like C shell + awk, and lookup the location of the data using the command-line script named :docs:`padre_buddy.py <padre_buddy.py>`.
