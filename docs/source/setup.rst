How to use this library
=========================

Accessing the data
********************

Recommended Method
	Since Python is a great language, and the library provides a lot of convenience functions for you, 
	the recommended method for accessing the data is using Python scripts that directly include the
	library.

The Not-Recommended Method
	If you hate Python, kittens, and love, you could write all of your scripts in some awful language,
	like C shell + awk, and lookup the location of the data using the command-line script :doc:`padre_buddy.py <padre_buddy.py>`.
	The :doc:`padre_buddy.py <padre_buddy.py>` script is really designed to help you have quick access to 
	the datasets on the command line, and wasn't meant to be a crutch to hold you back from migrating to Python. But, it's
	there if you need it.
